# Zynthora Ecosystem

**Zynthora** is a hybrid hardware/software modular ecosystem designed for collaborative electronic music performance.

## 🌌 The Vision: "The Ghost Modular"
An invisible, wireless modular system.
*   **Center:** The Brain (Pi Zero 2 W) + Battery + Wired Speaker.
*   **Orbit:** Wireless Control Modules (ESP32) + Mobile Phones.
*   **Experience:** Physical knobs, instant sound, zero cables between modules.

## 🎭 Modes of Play
1.  **The Conductor (Solo):** One user surrounds themselves with multiple modules (Sequencer, Bassline, Pads) to perform a full track alone.
2.  **The Orchestra (Multi-User):** Modules are distributed among friends. One person plays bass, another sequences drums.
3.  **The Mix:** A dedicated "Conductor Module" (Software or Hardware) acts as the mixer, controlling levels, mutes, and effects for all tracks generated by the other modules.

## 🧩 The Ecosystem
1.  **The Brain (Zynthora Engine):**
    *   **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W + PCM5102 DAC + Battery.
    *   **Role:** Audio Generation, BLE Central Hub, State Keeper, Recorder.
    *   **OS:** Patchbox OS (Real-Time Kernel).
2.  **The Modules (ESP32-C3 / S3):**
    *   **Hardware:** Custom PCBs or Breadboards with ESP32.
    *   **Power:** LiPo Battery (Truly wireless).
    *   **Role:** Send control events (Knobs, Buttons, Touch) via BLE.
    *   **Latency:** <20ms control latency (imperceptible for knobs).
3.  **The Lens (Mobile App):**
    *   Web/Mobile GUI for visual feedback and deep editing.
    *   Connects via WiFi/WebSockets.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture
*   **Event-Driven Core:** All actions are `SynthEvents` (Timestamp + SourceID + ParamID + Value).
*   **Audio Path:** Wired connection from Pi -> Speakers (Zero latency).
*   **Control Path:** Wireless (BLE/WiFi).
*   **Session Recording:** The system records *Events*, not Audio. A session is a tiny log file of every interaction, re-playable perfectly later.

## 🚀 Status
*   **Phase 1 (Current):** Building the Event Backbone (C++).
*   **Phase 2:** Hardware Integration (Pi Zero 2 W setup).
*   **Phase 3:** Module Prototyping (ESP32 code).
